I have always been fascinated by _novel_ mechanical clocks and I finally decided to build one. At first I was designing a clock made from two concentric hollow rings which would rotate to indicate the time. My hope was to hide the entire mechanism in the base making the movement seem "magical". This turned out to be far too complicated and rather then cutting gear teeth into the circumference of the rings I decided to abandon the project all-together. 

Somewhere around this time I came across [this amazing 7 segment mechanical display](https://hackaday.com/2022/10/09/flip-segment-digital-clock-is-a-miniature-mechanical-marvel/) which gave me some much needed motivation to actually build something. The concept I was going after was a mechanical 7 segment display but actuated by electronics to save on mechanical complexity. 

The body of the clock was to be made out of a single tube with 4 copies of 7 segment displays cut into it. The display would then be _updated_ by rotating rings inside the main tube such that either black or white portions would appear behind the cutouts. Turns out, with 3 rings behind each display, every single digit can be created. To actuate the 12 rings (3 rings per digit, 4 digits total) I designed a theta-z stage that uses 2 stepper motors along with a lead screw and some linear rails to move an actuation head axially throughout the body tube.

The whole thing is then masterminded by an arduino which interfaces with the stepper motors through a CNC shield. I will eventually need to add a RTC when long term stability becomes a limiting factor. There are also some custom (made from paperclips and superglue) limit switches to zero out both the angle and z position of the actuator head. Turns out that when designing tiny actuators, pre-built limit switches become a serious space constraint!

The "actuator head" is nothing more than a 3d printed part which has a protrusion at a known location. This protrusion sticks out radially far enough that it interferes with a similar protrusion on each display ring. Thus, to rotate the display rings, the actuator head needs to move to the correct z position and then push the ring in whichever direction is desired. Of course, since the actuation head is never captive in the display rings it can only "push" and never "pull". This does mean that the code needs to think about which direction to approach every display ring but on the other hand it removes the requirement of small tooth like features.

The display rings are actually not full rings and are more like C clips. This is important since while the actuator head is adjusting a specific display ring, the others are not locked in position by anything. The spring force that the C clip like display rings apply to the body tube is used to generate some friction and keep them in place.
